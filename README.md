# lunarcalgoog

This is an application that allows you to record lunar birthdays and save them in your google calendar account.

Roadmap and planned things:
  - Save google account info and implement login and logout (I'll probably use firebase, have to look into that)
  - Save events to google account or a way to synchronize events from calendar (maybe creating another separate calendar will be easier to retrieve)
  - Input date in terms of lunar date
  - Display time left until the next event date
  - Bug and stress testing (It sometimes failes and gives me a operation too frequent error, need to stress test to ensure it does not happen any more)
  - Upload application to google play store
  - Design and insert logo for this application
